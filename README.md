Hello Everyone I create one Project Name Library.

we all know that in library we get some books and we have list how many books we have book name and author name so this all data stored in dynamically and we use data structure here and ofcourse string (char array) for saving name and increase and decrease our book means memmove so, so many topics cover in this mini project i hope you like to learn that.

when you execute ./Library.exe you see the menu like this :
a/A:Add a new book to library (book name, author name and no.of pages)
l/L:List available books in library wiyth book name and author name
c/C:Display count of specific book
t/T:Take a book from library (before that we print all book so user can see the list and take book
s/S:Sort books for display
	1)Based on book name
	2)Based on author
f/F:find book in library
	1)Based on book name
	2)Based on author
q/Q:Quit from application



this is what i done in this project this is version 1 i will upload next version that is using linked list.
